## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Sass
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that the default pop-ups with forms when the correct information is not provided can be customized based on the ValidityState of the element. I also learned that inputs have a default outline when in use which needs to be removed before the border can be customized.

### Continued development

This challenge was the first time I have used Sass and it is definitely something I will continue to use in future projects. Being able to create mixins and nest elements made the whole project more efficient.

### Useful resources
